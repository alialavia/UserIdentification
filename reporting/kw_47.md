# 21.11 - 27.11

## Work Done

- Refactor/Update Core
- Working online recognition (offline training): Threaded Generic Request Handler with TCP Networking

## Notes/Remarks
**Task List**
- [ ] User Nice Names
- [ ] Unknown Detection/Novelty Detection in high dimensional space
	- Open Set Recognition: Parallel Single Class SVM with radial basis function (for all trained classes). If SVM gives negative result for all classes: New User
	- Random Forest
- [ ] Construct and evaluate maximum variance training set to find optimal comparison method
	- To find out: What is the most efficient way to capture training images of a person?
	- Needed for: Robust identification using image batch, detector training
- [ ] Online Classifier Training
   - [ ] Construct maximum variance training set/Selection of most efficient training method/training images
   - [ ] Implement Online Learning

**Experiments**

- [ ] Tool to generate labeled face captures efficiently (training data)
	- Automatic image taking for different angles: Use ICP based HD-Faces library from Kinect
- [ ] Evaluate Maximum Variance method for NN descriptor
	- **Test methods**: Chose method with max variance for descriptive test sets
		- Cosine Distance
		- PCA analysis
	- **Test set**:
		- Pictures with changing head orientation - Influence of head orientation
		- Influence of changing lighting condition (good lighting may be defined)
		- (Influence of Appearance (hair, glasses, makeup))
	- **Method:**
		- Generate dataset with different head orientations
		- Generate NN descriptors and corresponding distance/variance based identifier
		- Compare pictures which have max. distance/variation: How much influence has orientation?

**Bugfixing**
- [ ] User Manager: reject identification of same user in scene
- [ ] User Manager: Reset identification status from pending if error response is received		
		
		
## Challenges/Problems

## Literature

- Novelty Detection: [A review of novelty detection](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~davidc/pubs/NDreview2014.pdf)

## Personal Notes

- user::UserManager: Assuption: user scene ids do not change from frame to frame (they disappear first)


### Novelty/Outlier Detection

**Probabilistic**
Principle: Estimate general probability density function PDF of the data

Step 1: Estimate Density
- Observations
- Density estimate via Parzen-windows

Step 2: Threshold Density
- New data if probability is below threshold

Optimization: unify in high density regions

**Distance-Based**
- Nearest-Neighbour, Cluster-based
- not able to deal with high dimensional data efficiently

**Domain-Based**

### General PDF estimation

- Parzen Windows: Place smooth Gaussian over each training example. Kernel width can be set dynamicaly - smoother where there are only few data points
