# 21.11 - 27.11

## Work Done

- Refactor/Update Core
- Working online recognition (offline training): Threaded Generic Request Handler with TCP Networking

## Notes/Remarks
**Task List**
- [ ] User Nice Names
- [ ] Unknown Detection/Novelty Detection
	- Open Set Recognition: Parallel One Class SVM with radial basis function for (all trained classes). If SVM gives negative result for all classes: New User
- [ ] Construct and evaluate maximum variance training set to find optimal comparison method
- [ ] Online Classifier Training
   - [ ] Construct maximum variance training set
   - [ ] Implement Online Learning

**Experiments**

- [ ] Evaluate Maximum Variance method for NN descriptor
	- **Test methods**: Chose method with max variance for descriptive test sets
		- Cosine Distance
		- PCA analysis
	- **Test set**:
		- Pictures with changing head orientation - Influence of head orientation
		- Influence of changing lighting condition (good lighting may be defined)
		- (Influence of Appearance (hair, glasses, makeup))
