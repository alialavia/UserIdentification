### Model Evaluation/Metrics

### Data Decomposition
**Goal**: Data evaluation on subspace where cross-class distance is maximized
- [Cross-decomposition](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_decomposition.html#cross-decomposition)
	- Given 2 multivariate covarying two-dimensional datasets, X, and Y, PLS extracts the ‘directions of covariance’, i.e. the components of each datasets that explain the most shared variance between both datasets. 
	- " They will try to find the multidimensional direction in the X space that explains the maximum multidimensional variance direction in the Y space. PLS-regression is particularly suited when the matrix of predictors has more variables than observations, and when there is multicollinearity among X values. By contrast, standard regression will fail in these cases."

### Novelty Detection

#### Problem Outline

**Thesis problem setting**
- Euclidean distance of feature vector is a direct face similarity measure: Clustering possible
- High dimensional (128 dim) feature space 
- Classes: about 100

#### Method Evaluation

**Offline**
- One Class SVM
- Nearest Neighbour (Tax, 2001)

**Online**
- Cluster-based novelty detection (Spinoza, Carvalho, Gama, SAC 08)
	- Paper 2007: OLINDDA: a cluster-based approach for detecting novelty andconcept drift in data streams
	- Initial model generation (supervised batch)
	- Update: for each incomming feature, check if it is explained by current model. If yes: discarge, if close to cluster: extend model, if far away from cluster: generate new concept


### Online Open Set Learning

**Research Topics**
- Incremental Learning (fixed, known classes)
- Scalability
- Open Set Learning (unknown detection - unknown new classes. E.g. count occurences of 3 specimen with unknown number of specimens)

#### Problem Outline
- Design choice: Retrain whole set or use incremental learning
- Current SVM/CNN training time for ImageNet DB (about 32000 images, 1000 categories): 5-6 days
	- retraining becomes infeasible for many applications
- Algorithm must be incremental in terms of additional training samples AND additional training classes! Most online SVMs require all classes to be known
	- Incremental, scalable learning


#### Pure Incremental Learning
	
- Online SVM algorithms
	- Update cost: quadratic in the number of examples, depend heavily of nr support vectors stored
	
- Naive Bayes Classifier - Multinomial
	- The multinomial distribution normally requires integer feature counts

- Naive Bayes classifier for multivariate Bernoulli models
	- designed for binary/boolean features

- Perceptron
	- It does not require a learning rate.
	- It is not regularized (penalized).
	- It updates its model only on mistakes.
	- slightly faster to train than SGD with the hinge loss and that the resulting models are sparser

- SGD
	- regularized linear models with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) learning
	- works with data represented as dense or sparse arrays of floating point values for the features
	- model is updated along the way with a decreasing strength schedule (aka learning rate).
	- For best results using the default learning rate schedule, the data should have zero mean and unit variance.
- SGDA (averaged)

- Online Passive Agressive Classification
	- [Paper](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume7/crammer06a/crammer06a.pdf)
	- They are similar to the Perceptron in that they do not require a learning rate
	- PA-I: hinge loss, PA-II: squared hinge loss (performs better)

	
#### Novelty Detection

**Approaches**
- On-VS-All SVM (multiclass on-vs-all classifier with multiple binary classifiers)
- Closest-Set with Threshold (1. closed set 2. label outliers as new)

**Idea to test:**
- start with initial clusters
- calculate eigenvectors with minimal variance using PCA (most stable orientations for this class)
- calculate centroid
- novelty detection: project unknown feature onto different cluster eigenspaces. Evaluate class similarity using cosine distance (orientation is stronger wheighted) between feature and cluster centroid in the cluster Eigenspace.

	
#### Openset incremental learning
- Nearest Class Mean (NCM) - (nearest centroid classifier)
	- Linear classifier (in contrast to k-NN, more efficient)
	- Class only characterized by mean - sufficient performance?
	- distance based approch: natural choice for building scalable systems
	- Standard approach: Not suited for open set recognition: assumes close-set assumption for probability normalization
	- 1. samples undergo Mahalanobis transform 2. associated with cluster-mean (class)

	- [See paper for list of historic use cases](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Bendale_Towards_Open_World_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf)
	- No probability measure since it is an open set problem
	- Measure performance with success rate
	
- K-NN/Large Margin Nearest Neighbour (LMNN)
