**Important**
- Person Identification Using Anthropometric and Gait Data from Kinect Sensor: [link](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9680/9276)
Comparison between anthropometric attributes and gait attributes

 KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour) and SVM perform about equally well on the problem, but the chosen MLP performs considerably and consistently worse


## Personal Notes

### Classification/Clustering

**Bag of Words**
- Given: Categories, each represented by a set of features/descriptors (visual word)
- Choose category: Given a set of descriptors (visual words) choose category which contains the most words

**Principle Component Analysis**
- Can be used to reduce the data space while preserving maximum variance: ++Might be useful to reduce skeletal information++

**SVM: Support Vector Machines**

### Face Recognition


**Template Based**



**Geometry Based**

## Ensemble Classification/Learning

Ensemble learning: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning

- Bayes optimal classifier: Bayesian parameter averaging
- Bootstrap aggregating: votes with equal weight
- Stacking: Stacking (sometimes called stacked generalization) involves training a learning algorithm to combine the predictions of several other learning algorithms. First, all of the other algorithms are trained using the available data, then a combiner algorithm is trained to make a final prediction using all the predictions of the other algorithms as additional inputs. 
- AdaBoost/Boosting

## Re-identification
### 01. Re-identification using Face Matching

**Approach 1: Orientation based Tempalte Matching**
- **Idea**: During tracking pictures of the persons face/head are taken under different angles. During re-identification, we get the approximate head orientation from kinect and perform a template matching against the templates in this angular region.

### 0.1 Re-identification using Face Similarity

- **Idea**: Use convolutional neural network to build optimal facial descriptor (same person will yield roughly same descriptor). Distinguish different persons by applying a basic classification algorithm like SVM/GMM Classifier. [Short description](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-4-modern-face-recognition-with-deep-learning-c3cffc121d78#.w0acdfhei)
- **Problem**: Training of neural network requires extremely large datasets and computation power - not feasible
- **Discussion in Literature**

#### OpenFace
Represent face on 128dim  unit hyperspcere using neural network. Unlike other face representations, this embedding has the nice property that a larger distance between two face embeddings means that the faces are likely not of the same person

### 02. Re-identification using Static Skeletal Data
**Approach:** Build descriptor from static joint length. Use **PCA** to reduce dimensionality

### 03. Re-identification using Color Model

### 04. Re-identification using Specific Anthropomorphic Features
- Hair Color
- Skin Tone
- Gender
- Facial Geometry


### 05. Re-identification using Gait Detection


**Literature:**
- Full body gait  analysis  with  Kinect
- Evaluation  of  an  inexpensive  depth  camera for in-home gait assessment
- Gait  recognition  with  Kinect


## Classifications
similarity, probability and decision boundaries.


### Probabilistic Classification

- Template matching: Find most similar normalized template (Convolution)
