### Classification/Clustering





**Bag of Words**
- Given: Categories, each represented by a set of features/descriptors (visual word)
- Choose category: Given a set of descriptors (visual words) choose category which contains the most words





**Principle Component Analysis**


**SVM: Support Vector Machines**

- linearly separable binary sets


### Approach: identify person matched features 

Ensemble learning: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning

- Bayes optimal classifier: Bayesian parameter averaging
- Bootstrap aggregating: votes with equal weight
- Stacking: Stacking (sometimes called stacked generalization) involves training a learning algorithm to combine the predictions of several other learning algorithms. First, all of the other algorithms are trained using the available data, then a combiner algorithm is trained to make a final prediction using all the predictions of the other algorithms as additional inputs.

**Important**
- Person Identification Using Anthropometric and Gait Data from Kinect Sensor: https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9680/9276
Comparison between anthropometric attributes and gait attributes

 KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour) and SVM perform about equally well on the problem, but the chosen MLP performs considerably and consistently worse


## Features

### Skeletal data

- Static joint length
