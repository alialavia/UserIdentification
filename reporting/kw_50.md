# 12.12 - 18.12

## Work Done

## Notes/Remarks

**Multi-class classification - "one-against-one" approach**
- n_class * (n_class - 1) / 2  classifiers are cunstructed
- each one trains data from two classes


### Online Learning
- data: array of floating point values

#### Pure incremental
- Moving average of class descriptors - recalculate classification threshold, minimum intraclass variance
- Online SVM with SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)


#### Batch Relearning/out-of-core learning
- Random Forest, One-Class SVM (factor 100 faster, about same precision)

#### Probabilistic Model
- Weight descriptors based on viewing angle/magnitude of the normalization transformation


#### Incremental Methods

- SGD
- PassiveAgressive
