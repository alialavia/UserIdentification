## Notes/Remarks

**Currently most promessing Learning Approaches**


1. Separated Classification and Novelty Detection:
	1. Classification: Incremental linear SVM with SGD for Kernel Regression
		- RBF Kernel performs similar to linear kernel but is noticeable slower!
	2. Tree of One-Class classifiers, that are retrained if current model is not explained
		- not one-vs-all or one-vs-one! Models can be retrained individually
		- Use dimension reduction (shrinkeable to approx 35 dim) to save storage
		- Store training data of current model on harddrive
		- Reminder: might want to use temporal window on data to avoid drift
		- **Methods**: Isolation Forest, OneClassSVM(linear), OneClassSVM(rbf)
			- large dataset (15k samples): Isolation Forest > OneClassSVM(rbf) > OneClassSVM(linear)
			- small dataset (1.5k samples = 100s stream @15fps): SVM(linear) 0.06s > SVM(rbf) 0.082s > Isolation Forest 0.478
		
2. Multiclass Classifier with integrated novelty detection:
	1. Track centroid of classes and use separation threshold as classifier (nearest centroid classifier)
		- Cosine distance separates data the best
		- Evaluate distance on intra-class minimum variance subspace: clustering assumes univariant distribution
		- 

**Multi-class classification - "one-against-one" approach**
- n_class * (n_class - 1) / 2  classifiers are cunstructed
- each one trains data from two classes


### Online Learning
- data: array of floating point values

#### Pure incremental
- Moving average of class descriptors - recalculate classification threshold, minimum intraclass variance
- Online SVM with SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)


#### Batch Relearning/out-of-core learning
- Random Forest, One-Class SVM (factor 100 faster, about same precision)

#### Probabilistic Model
- Weight descriptors based on viewing angle/magnitude of the normalization transformation


#### Incremental Methods

- SGD
- PassiveAgressive
