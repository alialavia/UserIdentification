# 16.01 - 22.01

## Work Done
- Evaluate effects of Blur and Head orientation on feature generation with FaceNet
- Evaluation of multiple face frontalization methods and its impact on the feature generation with FaceNet
- Evaluation of other CNN Models (speed, accuracy, implementation, feature representation)
- Implementation of an angle based novelty detection (most promising at the moment)

## Notes/Remarks

- Angle based outlier detection seems most promising (appox 3% error on inliers and 0.1% on outliers)
- More datasets need to be evaluated and weights to be tuned
