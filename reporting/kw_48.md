# 28.11 - 04.12

## Work Done
- Automatic face capturing (headtracking, roll/pitch/yaw triggers image capturing)
- Blur metrics with training/evaluation tool for easy image acquisition and labeling
- Background subtraction
- Finished network protocol with automatic request/response routing, implemented on client and server side
- Joint velocity estimation (might be useful to prevent motion blur)
- Server side modularization: interchangeable classifiers, seperated user database (including nicenames), separated embeddings/feature generator

## Notes/Remarks

- Convolutional Network generates embedding/mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly(!) correspond to a measure of face similarity. see [FaceNet](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/app/1A_089.pdf)
- LAPV focus measure seems to give best results but still is not suitable for fine tuning: Evaluat speed estimation using skeleton tracking
- Joint Velocity Estimation: Not robust enough, use incremental averaging
- Incremental Averaging: [Algiithm, Stackexchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/106700/incremental-averageing)
- SKLearn SVM Probabilty measure: [Platt Scaling](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15111408/how-does-sklearn-svm-svcs-function-predict-proba-work-internally)

**Face Batch Preprocessing (Client Side)**
- Blur Detection
- Client Side Face Detection
- Orientation based image acquisition

**ToDos**
- [x] Fix classifier retraining: also store embeddings
- [x] Easy face capturing with blur labeling (to evaluate: blur detector)
- [ ] Blur detection parameter regression: Acquire dataset with labels (using created tool) and use (robust) regression algorithm to determine classification boundary

## Challenges/Problems

- winsock2.h produces conflicts with windows.h!
- Dlib Face detection often fails under bad lighting (if too dark on average)

### Online (incremental) Learning methods in SKLearn

**To keep in mind**
- Infinite data stream: incremental learning is necessary
- During online learning: Classifier/Concept Drift
- Decreasing learning rate
- Big data: Out-of-core/external memory needs:
	- streaming pipeline
	- incremental algorithm
- Introduce new classes during training?
- Non-linearly separable classes
	
**How to choose the appropriate method**
- Number of classes: ca. 100 (e.g. Open World Recognition performs better for >1000 classes)
- Number of samples: 1000s
	
	
> Is it necessary (performance-wise) to use online algorithm instead of relearning? ToDo: Test Training performance

### Similarity Metrics

**General-purpose**
- Euclidean dinstance
- Cosine similarity

**Online Metrics Learning**
- POLA (2004): online Mahalanobis distance learning
- LEGO (2009): Logdet Exact Gradient Online, improved version of POLA based on LogDet
- RDML (2009)
- MDML (2012): Mirror Descent Metric Leaning, general framework for online Mahalanobis distance learning based on composite mirror Descent (Duchi et al., 2010)

### Probability Propagation Framework

- from classifier: P(Personi | m), where m is the face embedding received from the neural network
- joint probability: P(Personi | m1, m2) = P(Personi | m1) * P(Personi | m2)
