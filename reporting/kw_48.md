## Work Done

## Notes/Remarks

- Convolutional Network generates embedding/mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly(!) correspond to a measure of face similarity. see [FaceNet](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/app/1A_089.pdf)
- LAPV focus measure seems to give best results but still is not suitable for fine tuning: Evaluat speed estimation using skeleton tracking
- Joint Velocity Estimation: Not robust enough, use incremental averaging
- Incremental Averaging: [Algiithm, Stackexchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/106700/incremental-averageing)

- SKLearn SVM Probabilty measure: [Platt Scaling](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15111408/how-does-sklearn-svm-svcs-function-predict-proba-work-internally)


**Face Batch Preprocessing (Client Side)**
- Blur Detection
- Client Side Face Detection
- Orientation based image acquisition

**ToDos**
- [ ] Fix classifier retraining: also store embeddings
- [ ] Easy face capturing with blur labeling (to evaluate blur detector)
- [ ] Blur detection parameter regression

## Challenges/Problems

- winsock2.h produces conflicts with windows.h!

### Similarity Metrics

**General-purpose**
- Euclidean dinstance
- Cosine similarity

**Online Metrics Learning**
- POLA (2004): online Mahalanobis distance learning
- LEGO (2009): Logdet Exact Gradient Online, improved version of POLA based on LogDet
- RDML (2009)
- MDML (2012): Mirror Descent Metric Leaning, general framework for online Mahalanobis distance learning based on composite mirror Descent (Duchi et al., 2010)


### Probability Propagation Framework

- from classifier: P(Personi | m), where m is the face embedding received from the neural network
- joint probability: P(Personi | m1, m2) = P(Personi | m1) * P(Personi | m2)
