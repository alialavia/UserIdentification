# 19.12 - 25.12

## Work Done

## Notes/Remarks

- Check tensor flow FaceNet implementation to boost accuracy (maybe then clustering classifier can be deployed)

## Challenges/Problems

## Literature/Personal Notes

- [FaceNet implementation in tensor flow - claims 0.98 accuracy](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet)
