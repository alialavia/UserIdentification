# 19.12 - 25.12

## Work Done

## Notes/Remarks


**ToDo**
- network protocoll: change image sizes to (small) (client and server side)
- implement image receival methods
- finish alignment comparison demo
- test and compare client side alignment

### Outlook

**Client/Server**
- Direct embedding collection upon initialization (when server is not initialized, for every user that enters the scene directly assign id. when a user has left the scene: STOP)

**Embedding Generation**
- Check tensor flow FaceNet implementation to boost accuracy (maybe then clustering classifier can be deployed)
- automatic image collection: background subtraction of face, use entropy to measure difference
- Use Kinect Face Tracking for alignment: speed boost

**Classification**
- use ensemble learning
- use cosine distance for direct image-to-class comparison (check if it's a novelty for sure: set threshold higher as max intra-class separation)
- test incremental one-vs-all training for each class against lfw: check performance for 1, 2, 3... training images of target class
- weight samples by head pose (alignment magnitude)
- method using "educated" guess based on weak classifier (high false positive, low false negative rate)?

**Features**
