# 19.12 - 25.12

## Work Done

## Notes/Remarks


**ToDo**
- network protocoll: change image sizes to (small) (client and server side)
- implement image receival methods
- finish alignment comparison demo
- test and compare client side alignment

### Outlook

**Client/Server**
- Direct embedding collection upon initialization (when server is not initialized, for every user that enters the scene directly assign id. when a user has left the scene: STOP)
- Global user manager: Multi-camera setup for same scene

**Embedding Generation**
- Check tensor flow FaceNet implementation to boost accuracy (maybe then clustering classifier can be deployed)
- automatic image collection: background subtraction of face, use entropy to measure difference
- Use Kinect Face Tracking for alignment: speed boost

**Classification**
- use ensemble learning
- use cosine distance for direct image-to-class comparison (check if it's a novelty for sure: set threshold higher as max intra-class separation)
- test incremental one-vs-all training for each class against lfw: check performance for 1, 2, 3... training images of target class
- weight samples by head pose (alignment magnitude)
- method using "educated" guess based on weak classifier (high false positive, low false negative rate)?
- background subtraction on face patches: influence?
- test different metrics: inner product, weighted chi-squared
- pairwise distance evaluation - problem: which image is most representative. Try: 
	- image corresponding to mean embedding (nearest dist to all others)
	- Mean face
- Softmax: http://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/
	
- Test Multilayer Perceptron with SDG/LBFGS optimization: 
	- Allows to set sample weights
	- Incremental, learn non-liear models
	- Timing?

**Features**
- Face/Skin Color
- Depth Features (e.g. SIFT feature comparison with RANSAC matching)
- User Color Model
- Skeleton

**Face Frontalization**
- Implement: https://github.com/dougsouza/face-frontalization
- Fixed center crop: corners being (83,92) and (166,175) (facial landmark indices)
