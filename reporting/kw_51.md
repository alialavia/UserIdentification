# 19.12 - 25.12

## Work Done

## Notes/Remarks


**ToDo**
- network protocoll: change image sizes to (small) (client and server side)
- implement image receival methods
- finish alignment comparison demo
- test and compare client side alignment

### Outlook

**Client/Server**
- Direct embedding collection upon initialization (when server is not initialized, for every user that enters the scene directly assign id. when a user has left the scene: STOP)
- Global user manager: Multi-camera setup for same scene
- Define scene boundary: filter flickering/partwise occlusion

**Embedding Generation**
- Check tensor flow FaceNet implementation to boost accuracy (maybe then clustering classifier can be deployed)
- automatic image collection: background subtraction of face, use entropy to measure difference
- Use Kinect Face Tracking for alignment: speed boost
- Note: retraining of the CNN necessary if different face alignment is selected

**Classification**
- use ensemble learning
- use cosine distance for direct image-to-class comparison (check if it's a novelty for sure: set threshold higher as max intra-class separation)
- test incremental one-vs-all training for each class against lfw: check performance for 1, 2, 3... training images of target class
- weight samples by head pose (alignment magnitude)
- method using "educated" guess based on weak classifier (high false positive, low false negative rate)?
- background subtraction on face patches: influence?
- test different metrics: inner product, weighted chi-squared
- pairwise distance evaluation - problem: which image is most representative. Try: 
	- image corresponding to mean embedding (nearest dist to all others)
	- Mean face
- Softmax: http://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/	
- Test Multilayer Perceptron with SDG/LBFGS optimization: 
	- Allows to set sample weights (based on alignment measure)
	- Incremental, learn non-liear models
	- Timing?
	- http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html
	- http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor.html
	- https://gist.github.com/amueller/2061456
- Probabilistc approach: 
	- Use Gaussian distribution related to interclass separation, 
	- combination with limited Gaussian Mixture Model of high value samples (stronger aligned images are rated weaker)
- Learn per-Class weights for individual dimensions (based in intra-class variance) and computer inner vector product
- Clean out LFW dataset: Only one image per person - recalculate pairwise inter-class separation
	
- **Promissing** (identification for ca. 100 people):
	- Keep subset of samples (ca. 1000) for each person, update from time to time
	- calculate mean and PDF from pairwise cosine-distance to centroid
	- use probability threshold for unknown detection
	- 100000 samples = 100 MB
	- 0.029 sec calc time for pairwise cosine distance to centroid with 13000 samples (complete LFW)
	- if lots of features are present: project on class subspace (subspace of centroid) - increases seperability
	
**Features**
- Face/Skin Color
- Depth Features (e.g. SIFT feature comparison with RANSAC matching)
- User Color Model (implement! Strong classifier, Models can be reseted e.g. when office is closed)
- Skeleton (implement! Useful anyway)
- Retrain CNN with depth images

**Face Frontalization**
- Implement: https://github.com/dougsouza/face-frontalization
- Fixed center crop: corners being (83,92) and (166,175) (facial landmark indices)
