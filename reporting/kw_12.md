# 27.03 - 31.03

## Work Done

- Nearest subset classification (performe accuracy classification only on "near" classes)
- Tuned face sampling (faster identification)
- Fix Kinect ID switching: Track users involved, perform closed set classification
- Body part segmentation (for possible multi-modal classification or short time tracking)
- Presentation for recording sessions

## Notes/Remarks

**ToDos**
- [ ] When user identifcation times out: Request guess on user id. All possible inlier classes or unknown
- [ ] Test other template matching algorithms:
