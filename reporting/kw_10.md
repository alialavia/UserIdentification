## Work Done

- Report: Literature review open-set user identifcation, positioning, kinect tracking failure modes, ...

## Notes/Remarks

Meta Recognition for Rotational Variance Balacing:
- Weight individual embedding by amount of pitch/yaw or alignment transformation magnitude
- Weights calculated from deviation of the feature vector from a neutral image
- Yaw and Pitch combined: Additive weighting (?) (check in measurements)

Allows:
- Ignore risky updates
- Balance measurement certainty in set classification
