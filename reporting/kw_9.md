# 13.03-17.03

## Work Done

- Planing of recording session
- Skin color detection (might be used to detect colored lighting or object detection)
- Report

## Notes/Remarks

**ToDos**
- [x] Fix RGB/BGR channel swapping

## Challenges/Problems

- Patterns projected onto faces
	- [x] use skin color detection
	- Test influence of color
	- Test embeddings of grayscale (HSV?) images (more robust to color variations)

**Improvements**
- Detect Object Tracking
	- Check skin color
	- Torso/Upper Body detection
	- Movement (Face ROI, Optical Flow)
	- Skeleton Joint Angles (Spine/Head)
