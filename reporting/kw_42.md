# 17.10 - 23.10

## Work Done
- Development environment setup (Kinect SDK V2 requires Win 8 or later)
- CMake basis project
- Project schedule
- Kinect camera connector class (generalized and direct implementation)

## Challenges/Problems
- Official Microsoft Kinect SDK 2 only supports a single Kinect (Kinect V1, Kinect V2 is possible though)
- Kinect only supports USB3 Controller from Intel/Renesas. Motherboard of desktop computer has a Etron USB 3.0 Controll which sadly does NOT work...


## Notes/Remarks

**Streaming technique**
- Kinect SDK v2 has an independant source model (sources do not depent on each other)
- Stream synchronization through multisource: color image might go to 15 fps when lights go low
- SDK v2 uses polling instead of event passed stream access: `AcquireLatestFrame`
	- return: `E_PENDING`: new frame is not ready, `E_FAIL`: source is not released yet

```
while(True):
    do stuff
    check if event has happened (poll)
    do other stuff
```

**Data buffering**
- be carefull with direct source access!
- `AccessRawUnderlyingBuffer` provides pointer to source data which gets deleted once the source is released (done after each pol! Data won't be accessable after polling call.). Instead use `CopyRawFrameDataToArray` if no typeconversion is necessary.

**Frame access:**
An application should get the data out of each frame and close/dispose it as quickly as possible to free up the underlying handle and make sure that the system does not need to keep allocating new items to store incoming frame data.


- CopyRawFrameDataToArray: Copies the raw frame data into the array provided
- CopyRawFrameDataToBuffer: Copies the raw frame data into the buffer provided


**Streams**
- BodyIndex: 512x424@30fps, 6 people, value: 0-5 (people), 255 (background)


**Stream Coordinate Systems**
- ColorSpace (coordinate system of color image): Color image
- DepthSpace (coordinate system of depth image): Depth, Infrared, BodyIndex
- CameraSpace (coordinate system located at depth sensor - world coordinates): Body (joints)

++Mapping is done through SDK coordinate mapper++

## Literature/Personal Notes

**Kinect SDK 2**
- Programming flow and available streams: [link](http://de.slideshare.net/MatteoValoriani/programming-with-kinect-v2)
- API overview (Microsoft): [link](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn782033.aspx)

**OpenCV Memory Management**
- OpenCV uses a reference counting system for memory management. The idea is that each Mat object has its own header, however the matrix may be shared between two instance of them by having their matrix pointers point to the same address. Moreover, the copy operators will only copy the headers and the pointer to the large matrix, not the data itself.
- Sometimes you will want to copy the matrix itself too, so OpenCV provides the clone() (copies only header) and copyTo() (copy complete structure and data) functions
- Hint: resize allocates new mat, even when resizing to the same size
