-	Base application implementation scheme (detection, classification/description, identification)
-	Sensor calibration application (masking, parameter tuning, interest point definition)
-	User feature descriptors implementation
-	Session based probabilistic identification
-	Offline identification database
-	Evaluation and handling of environmental influences
-	Demo Applications

**User Study**
-	Sensor setup/positioning
-	Robustness/Performance (different people, lighting)
